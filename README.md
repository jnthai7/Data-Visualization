# Data Visualization
## Functionalities
 - The left side has checkbox interactions used to select data presented on the parallel plot.
 - The right side has a survey that the audience could take and submit data to the plot for direct comparison to others that are part of the data.
 - As a conclusion, the user can open a correlation plot to view feature correlations if they could not figure it out from the plot--in which it may be hard since there was little correlation.
 - The "Outcome" pole determines whether or not a given individual should seek medical attention due to the nature of their mental wellbeing. After the user takes the survey, they can determine
      their outcome based on the positioning of the deep pink line on the outcome pole.
## Instructions
 - Run through live server
 - Use the checkboxes on the left side of the screen to select various input data and additional output poles.
 - Optionally, take the survey on the right and submit to add your data among present data intended for direct comparison.

## Remarks
